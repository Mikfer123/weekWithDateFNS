# weekWithDateFNS

## Task Description

The task was to create a view that shows a calendar for 7 days and presents the current time based on the user's location. Additionally, the interaction via "Next Week" and "Prev Week" buttons should allow users to navigate through subsequent weeks.
Assigned Criteria for Coloring Days in the Calendar:

1. Today's date should be indicated with a shadow of green font.
2. Past dates should be displayed in gray.
3. Future dates, the week ahead, should have light green font color.

## Project Structure

### The project consists of two versions of the solution:

1. Without using the date-fns.js library: In this case, the date and time logic were implemented independently.
2. Using the date-fns.js library: This version of the code used functions from the date-fns.js library for date and time operations.

## Biggest Challenge and Learnings

The biggest challenge was implementing date logic and manipulating days in the calendar without utilizing the date-fns.js library. Working on this task allowed a deeper understanding of date and time operations in JavaScript and improved proficiency in working with them.

Using the date-fns.js library significantly simplified the task, leading to a more efficient and readable solution.

In summary, working on this project taught valuable lessons about managing time and dates in JavaScript and leveraging available tools like the date-fns.js library to streamline and simplify implementations.
